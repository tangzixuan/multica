-- Lark (飞书) Bot integration queries. The migration that defines these
-- tables lives at server/migrations/109_lark_integration.up.sql; the
-- architectural boundaries the package enforces on top of them are
-- documented in server/internal/integrations/lark/doc.go.
--
-- Scoping convention: every public-facing read goes through a
-- workspace-scoped variant where one exists. The lookups that take only
-- a UUID PK (e.g. GetLarkInstallation) are reserved for internal trusted
-- callers (the WS lease scanner, the inbound dispatcher after identity
-- resolution); HTTP handlers should prefer the *InWorkspace forms.
